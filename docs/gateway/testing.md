# Gateway test selection and acceptance

Run commands from the repository root. Tests use private state, scratch listeners
and owned child processes; they must not use the live daemon or default service
port. A sandbox that denies scratch socket binds cannot validate these fixtures.

For a localized change, start with the affected package and its meaningful
failure boundaries. Examples of existing focused checks:

```sh
go test ./internal/gateway/core -run '^TestDecodeBoundaries$' -count=1
go test ./internal/gateway/backend -run '^TestBounded(Channels|Agents)Collector$' -count=1
go test ./pkg/irc -run '^Test(ChannelsRaw|AgentsRaw|ObserveSignalsRaw|ObserveSelects)' -count=1
go test ./internal/gateway/adapter -run '^TestMCP' -count=1
go test ./integration/gateway -run '^TestCurrentGatewayBinaryKeepsFixturesIsolated$' -count=1 -timeout=180s
go vet ./internal/gateway/backend ./pkg/irc
```

Replace the selection with tests that exercise the changed behavior; these
examples are not a mandatory sequence. Add `-race` for changed concurrency or
lifetime ownership. Published contracts, authorization, cryptography, durable
state and cross-process behavior require the relevant broader checks even for
small diffs. Integration tests need enough time for the first fixture build.

`-count=1` bypasses successful test-result caching. Gateway integration builds
`cmd/airc-gateway` at runtime and exports/builds a pinned native fixture. Native
CLI subprocess tests also build their child executable at runtime, and some
example checks invoke `go run`. Go's test cache does not model all source inputs
of these external build commands: an integration-package cache hit can skip
rebuilding and exercising a changed gateway executable. Use `-count=1` whenever
validating those boundaries or measuring timings. The Go compilation cache still
applies; bypassing test-result caching does not imply a cold build. Record cache
conditions rather than deleting a shared build cache for routine checks.

Only immutable binaries may be shared across fixtures. Each invocation must own
its accounts, credentials, configuration, state, sockets and process lifetime.
Per-process lazy builds do not constitute a verified cross-run fixture cache.

At integration checkpoints, run full normal and race acceptance on unchanged
executable source:

```sh
go test ./... -count=1 -timeout=900s -p=1
go test -race ./... -count=1 -timeout=900s -p=1
go build ./cmd/...
go vet ./...
```

Check formatting with `gofmt -l` on changed Go files and whitespace with
`git diff --check`. Repository guidance also calls for staticcheck; use the
available repository toolchain without introducing a dependency upgrade merely
to run it. Full acceptance is required after architectural, authentication,
durable-state, published-API or cross-carrier changes, and before final roadmap
acceptance. A documentation-only checkpoint does not need another runtime run.

Capture source revision, Go version, host/load and cache conditions, command,
terminal exit result and package/leaf timings for performance comparisons.
Separate normal from race measurements. `-p=1` is the comparable starting point;
measure package concurrency separately from within-package parallelism. Runtime
child instrumentation and fixed native deadlines are part of the workload.
Keep one genuine expiry/deadline witness wherever the test makes that claim.
Do not report speed improvement from a skipped assertion, missing race coverage,
failed run or unmatched workload. The final acceptance execution must be fresh;
earlier baseline or affected-test passes do not certify the final source tree.

## Normal baseline before test-speed changes

On 2026-10-06, Go 1.27.1 on Darwin arm64 ran
`go test -json ./... -count=1 -timeout=900s -p=1` from Go/test source revision
`71181079a3e5cf1c9ff833267d83cabc7e8a0ea5`. Subsequent documentation checkpoints
changed no Go files, module files, example fixtures or embedded skill inputs.
Compilation caches were warm from prior builds; successful test-result caching
was disabled. No competing benchmark or race run was started during this run.
Host load averages were 14.79/15.96/15.64 before and 50.23/24.46/18.94 after;
this is a loaded-host baseline, not a stable performance estimate.

The command exited 1 after 971.14 seconds wall time (127.33 user, 33.08 system).
Gateway integration timed out at 900.483 seconds while
`TestUnixgramQuietWatchHeartbeatAndLeaseExpiry` was running. Its two surviving
scratch children were identified by exact PID and temporary executable path,
then stopped with SIGINT. Every other executed package passed; there was no
individual test assertion failure before the integration timeout. Tests after
the interrupted Unix-datagram check did not run and are not covered by this pass
record. This is baseline evidence, not full acceptance.

Completed package times include CLI 25.619s, adapter 11.042s, store 9.133s,
backend 2.535s, server 1.644s and SDK 0.964s. The slowest completed leaf tests
(excluding aggregate parent durations) were:

| Test | Seconds |
|---|---:|
| `TestDTLSMalformedAndUnauthorizedRecordsDoNotRenewIdle` | 32.570 |
| `TestCoAPRevocationDeniesFreshWorkAndExpiresExistingLease` | 16.390 |
| `TestRPCQuietStreamReturnsCorrelatedTerminalAndClosesLease` | 16.330 |
| `TestGRPCQuietStreamTerminalAndNativeLeaseCleanup` | 16.310 |
| `TestMCPHTTPWatchRenewsAndResumesSealedCursor` | 16.290 |
| `TestDTLSQuietWatchContiguousHeartbeatAndLeaseExpiry` | 16.270 |
| `TestUDPQuietWatchHeartbeatCursorAndLeaseExpiry` | 16.270 |
| `TestRawQUICQuietDatagramWatchExpiresWithContiguousSequence` | 16.250 |
| `TestHTTPEventsRetainedPrefixResumeAndLeaseExpiry` | 15.060 |
| `TestReplySignalOverUnixAndStdio` | 12.150 |

These totals include fixture setup and cleanup. They do not isolate build or
startup cost; that decomposition and the equivalent race measurement remain
required before closing the baseline roadmap items. The current gateway child
was built with `-race` even for this normal parent run, with SHA-256
`22052f470807138817b44f1c365ca0a6fc16f8aa18d100bc384ec61425089880`.
